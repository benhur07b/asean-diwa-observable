# Indicators

This page details the key indicators that the project has identified. In particular, we focused on both numerical data (e.g. rates, counts) that demonstrate tangible outcomes as well as categorical data (e.g. the presence of supportive laws, cultural challenges, etc.) that provide better nuance of the challenges and opportunities in driving digital innovation for women's advancement and understanding the barriers to women’s full participation in the digital economy across the ASEAN region.
