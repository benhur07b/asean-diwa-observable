CAT-00008,Malaysia,MYS,Yes,2010,1nita Project,,"The 1Nita Project, initiated in 2010 by Malaysia's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), was designed to empower rural women entrepreneurs by enhancing their digital skills and facilitating their participation in the digital economy. Organized by .my Domain Registry and supported by partners such as the E-Community Research Centre at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), the National Council of Women's Organizations (NCWO), and the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC), the project provided training and resources to help women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) establish an online presence.

An impact study conducted in 2011 indicated that the project had a positive effect on participants' ICT literacy and business outcomes. Approximately 60% of participants demonstrated satisfactory computer proficiency, and some reported increases in sales ranging from 30% to 60% after utilizing online platforms for marketing and sales. However, the study also highlighted challenges such as limited digital literacy among older participants and difficulties in maintaining online business platforms. These findings underscored the importance of ongoing support and training to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of such initiatives.

As of 2025, there is limited publicly available information confirming the current operational status of the 1Nita Project. The official website and social media channels associated with the project have not been updated in recent years, suggesting that the initiative may no longer be active.
