CAT_00007,SIngapore,SGP,No Data,2007,Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) ,,"The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) serve as a foundational policy in Singapore promoting fairness, meritocracy, and inclusivity in the workplace. The guidelines encourage employers to make employment decisions—such as hiring, promotion, and training—based on skills, experience, and ability, rather than personal characteristics like gender, age, or marital status. They explicitly discourage discriminatory job advertisements and practices, and advocate for inclusive workplace cultures backed by clear grievance handling processes. 

Importantly, the guidelines support flexible work arrangements to help employees manage caregiving responsibilities, which is especially relevant for improving women’s retention and progression in male-dominated sectors like ICT. While voluntary, these guidelines have been widely adopted and are actively promoted by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), playing a significant role in advancing gender equality in Singapore’s digital and tech workforce.",https://www.tal.sg/tafep/-/media/tal/tafep/getting-started/files/tripartite-guidelines.ashx ,
