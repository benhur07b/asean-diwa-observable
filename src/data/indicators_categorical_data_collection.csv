CAT-00006,Brunei Darussalam,BRN,No Data,,,,"While Brunei has conducted National ICT Surveys since 2013, they are usually focused on household data and just aggregated by gender when applicable. They still don't have ICT surveys which aims to address gender gaps in ICT. ",,https://www.aiti.gov.bn/events-and-publications/surveys/?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&searchTerms= 
CAT-00006,Cambodia,KHM,No Data,,,No Data,"There are no initiatives on gender-aggregated ICT data, and even during the numerical data collection there are few sources on regular and reliable gender-aggregated ICT data for Cambodia. The closest thing for data collection that exists is analysis on skills gap assessment for ICT.

CAT-00006,Lao PDR,LAO,No Data,,,No Data,"While Laos has gender-disasggregated data on basic ICT statistics like internet and phone access, they come from major surveys in the country like the Labour Force Survey and the Lao Social Indicator Survey, or even from international organzationals like UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey programme. However, Lao PDR has recognized this issue on the lack of gender-aggregated data on ICT access, skills, and industry participation. The strengthening of their national gender statistics and improvements in its quality, accessibility, and comprehensive has been discussed in analysis as a priority solution.

CAT-00006,Malaysia,MYS,No Data,,,,"Malaysia has made strides in collecting gender-disaggregated ICT data through national surveys like the annual ICT Use and Access by Individuals and Households Survey by DOSM, but these efforts lack depth and consistency. The Statistics on Women Empowerment in Selected Domains, Malaysia 2024 highlights that while women have surpassed men in education and achieved near parity in health, significant gaps remain in economic participation and political empowerment. The Malaysia Gender Gap Index (MGGI) score of 0.705 in 2023 shows moderate progress, with urban centers performing better. However, without more comprehensive and ICT-specific data frameworks, it is difficult to develop effective gender-responsive digital policies. Improved data collection is essential to bridge digital gaps and support inclusive development.",Department of Statistics Malaysia,https://www.dosm.gov.my/portal-main/release-content/statistics-on-women-empowerment-in-selected-domains-malaysia-2024
CAT-00006,Singapore,SGP,,,,,"Singapore’s data collection and analysis initiatives on gender and ICT are primarily driven by government agencies and aim to support inclusive digital transformation through evidence-based policymaking. The Department of Statistics (SingStat) regularly publishes gender-disaggregated data on education, employment (including in ICT), income, and technology use, while the Ministry of Education (MOE) tracks female participation in STEM and tech-related education. 

A cornerstone effort is the Digital Readiness Survey (DRS) conducted by IMDA, which provides gender-disaggregated insights on ICT access, usage, skills, and attitudes. It identifies gaps in digital participation—particularly among women, seniors, and lower-income groups—and informs national initiatives like Digital for Life. The survey reveals patterns such as lower digital confidence and higher online safety concerns among women, guiding targeted interventions. Additionally, IMDA’s ICT Manpower Survey tracks gender representation in the tech workforce. Together, these initiatives help shape policies that address the digital gender divide, though more granular, intersectional data—such as on women’s participation in tech entrepreneurship—could further strengthen gender-sensitive planning.",,https://www.imda.gov.sg/for-community/digital-readiness 
CAT-00006,Thailand,THA,No Data,,,,"Thailand has data on ICT access and ICT work by gender pubslished by its National Statistics Office. However, there are no comprehensive data on ICT skills and ICT workforce participation except for small surveys by independent researchers.
