CAT-00002,Malaysia,MYS,No Data,,,,"Malaysia has made general commitments to gender equality and digital transformation, but the systematic integration of gender into ICT-specific policies remains limited. Existing frameworks mention womenâ€™s digital inclusion in broad terms, yet lack concrete gender mainstreaming strategies, targets, or monitoring systems.

While the policy promotes nationwide digital inclusion and identifies women and youth as key beneficiaries of digital upskilling initiatives, it lacks clear gender-specific provisions or measurable, disaggregated targets to address existing gender gaps.",,https://www.mydigital.gov.my/

However, gender integration is more prominently featured in targeted programs rather than being a core component of all ICT-specific policies.",,
